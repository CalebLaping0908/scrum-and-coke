Today I worked on:

JWTdown for FastAPI continues to be a struggle.  While awaiting assistance, created a signup form for new users.  Finally, with help from Alex, Liz and I were able to solve our authentication struggles.  ...UserToken instead of Token!  ...also created Nav.js and UsersList.js 

## Feb 21, 2023
Today I worked on:

Group coding the JWTdow for FastAPI from start to finish with the entire team.  Still no success in overcoming this blocker, so we reached out to HMU and SEIRs.

Today I worked on:

Re-watching the D4:Backend Authentication video describing the use of JWTdown for FastAPI and attempting to implement for "users".

Today I worked on:

Implementing the remaining endpoints for Users including Create User, Get Users, Get User and Delete User.  The code refactoring in the videos was especially eye-opening, but I am left confused regarding the proper way to implement error codes.  Is code manipulation using response.status_code appropriate, or should raiseHTTPException be used?  I will either ask in class or post on help-me-understand.

Today I worked on:

Skeleton code setup and Users FastAPI as a team coding exercise.  We decided that we should all program the FastAPI MVP level services independently to gain traction and cement our understanding of FastAPI before heading into the wild with stretch goals.  We will select one individual's code to merge.

Today I worked on:

Project organization, DB decision (postgres) and skeleton code creation as a team.  We struggled to resolve "port already in use" issues with several team members who installed pgAdmin on their machines.

## Feb 14, 2023
Today I worked on:

Project organization as a team and issue creation in Git.

Milestone creation was a familiar and reassuring option to see.  Now if our MVP target needs to slide, we can update the milestone, rather than each individual task's due date.
