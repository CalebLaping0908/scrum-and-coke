Today, I worked on:

- Creating the boards endpoint,
  and implementing fully functioning CRUD operations
  for it

I created the boards table in the database. Then I worked on
the post request to be able to create a new board, and tested it
with the Swagger UI that FastAPI provides. I then wrote a function
to get a list of all of the boards in the database, tested that, and so
on with the same process of building and testing.
The other functionality I added was being able to delete a board, to update
a board, and to view a specific board.

I realized today that I really like FastAPI so far and I love how **fast** it is! Haha.
It's been really nice to start getting experience with another framework
and has been rewarding to see the features succeed. I'm excited to keep building
our application.

Today, I worked on:

- Finishing CRUD operations for the users endpoint

I learned a lot about FastAPI today. I also ran into some new errors which was
a good challenge to figure out by myself.

Today, my team and I worked on:

- Getting the users endpoint started

My team and I worked on creating a post request to be able to
add a new user to the database. We created a users table in our database
to send the data from the post request to, and worked on getting
the router set up. We also used the connection pool to connect to
our database, and that was exciting.

To view our database and the tables inside, we got familiar with
Beekeeper, a new technology that seems great so far, and we were
really excited when we were able to visually see the tables that we
created.

Today, my team and I worked on:

- Getting our database created and setting up our service,
  and getting our yaml file all ready to go

We worked on creating our database, which was our first time doing that,
so that was fun. We also discussed the overall design of our application
and how the different data will tie in with each other.
