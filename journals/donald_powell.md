Worked on the board detail view as a group. Closed out a few of the issues. Todd was able to get the board list view working and the ability
to move tasks based on their status from a dropdown! He's the best. Now we just need to push and make some small tweaks.
Liz has a lot of ideas about the CSS and wanting to make this look super cool. I'll let her cook on that because I trust her sense of taste more than my own.

Worked on deployment. Had to install a bunch of programs for deployment and I had my 1:1, so that took a few hours.
Also, the deployment took longer because there were a few instructions missing on how to do the actual deployment.

Spent a MARATHON session of 15 hours today working on the task list view. Todd, Liz, and myself created a table named "status" and linked
that as a foreign key to status so we can pull the status of a task. We hard coded the status table, so we just need to reference that.
Got it all working 3 minutes before zoom shut down for the night. Glorious!

Worked a few hours today, Sunday, on creating a Task View. I am having trouble with the React not using the "map" function correctly.
I know what it's asking but I'm not pulling data. It can't map over undefined which means that we have no data.
But I clearly see my data from the endpoint. not sure.

# 2/24/2023

Worked on creating a task list view and detail view.
This is not going as smoothly as I had hoped.
This board detail page is going to require tasks to work. Hopefully, we can query the databases correctly.

# 2/23/2023

Created a Users and Boards database.
Used Foreign Keys (assignee and task) to link those databases to Users.

I like Sql and I also don't like Sql.
But going forward, using that over Mongo should help us in the future?
Who knows?!

# 2/17/2023

Worked on getting our endpoints setup via FastAPI. We added the routes to the routers to make sure they were accessible.


# 2/16/2023

Worked on creating our databases and getting our service setup.
We also went over the design with Excalidraw and made sure we all had the same vision for the project.
