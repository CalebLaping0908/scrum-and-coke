Last day. Worked on some simple bug fixes and added some last pieces of functionality. Our project looks great and I'm so proud of everything we've accomplished. I'm exhaused, I'm gonna go take a 48 hour nap.

Day 3, finally escaped hell. Through Alex's help we were able to finally get our project deployed. This has significantly slowed down how quickly we can work on new features but our mvp is done so it isn't a big deal.

Day 2 of hell. Donald and I continued working through deployment and there is still no light at the end of the tunnel. We're getting a little closer but there's just no information in caprover to work off of so it's almost impossible to tell what's wrong.

Today was the first day of hell. Donald and I started working through deployment part 2-3 and it has been a disaster. The documentation is terrible and there's very little feedback given by caprover to work off of.

Today the practice exam was really hard so I was exhausted and got almost nothing done all day.

# 3/3/2023

Donald bricked his computer working with deployment so I worked with Todd and Liz to finish some frontend elements particularly showing a specific assignee name inside of the task detail page.

# 3/2/2023

Today I worked on a failsafe in the event my team can't complete their board detail view. Just in case.

# 3/1/2023

Finished up a few frontend features as well as updating logout page.

Today I wrapped up working on frontend auth while my team worked on frontend views.

# 2/24/2023

Today I worked on frontend auth and protecting our endpoints.

# 2/23/2023

Today I updated the task table to have foreign keys to boards and users. Walked through the migration process with Donald to reinfornce understanding.

# 2/17/2023

Today I worked on creating task endpoints so they show up in our FastAPI swagger.

# 2/16/2023

Today I worked on our migrations to setup our database so we can see them in beekeeper.
